# Foolish Dreams : A Pseudoregalia themed mod 
Foolish dreams is mod attempting to bring Pseudoregalia to Balatro while trying to keep a certain 'Vanilla feel' to it, for now this mod is not complete complete as there's still quite more elements to add, but i  consider adding them progressively as i make the mod.

# What's Pseudoregalia anyway ?
An 3D Metroidvania indie-game made by Rittz. Do i recommand it ? Yes, even if the lore is thin, i do recommand to give a look to a gampelay of the game or better, PLAY IT YOURSELF before playing this mod, but that however you feel like.

# What this mod will have ?
So far you have :
- 9 Jokers (3 being legendaries)
- 1 Tarot Card
- 1 Enhancement type
- 1 Boss Blind

But of course, there will be more.

# The new boss blind is just like The Wall.
Yeah i know, i didn't found a good way YET to set the new boss blind, but i'll try to figure out something that is challenging, don't worry.

# How do i instal it ?

1) Instal the Lovely Injector :  https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector
2) Get Steamoded (https://github.com/Steamodded/smods), and put it inside your Balatro save folder (precised in Steamoded's installation guide)
3) Get the most recent release (or an older one for some reason) of the mod, extract it and drop it in the 'Mods' folder of the Balatro folder mentioned in the previous step (If Steammodded was installed correctly, you should see the mod folder)

And you're done ! If you launch the game and see the mod after clicking the Mod button, then everything has been done coretly !

# WARNING
I  only used Non-Gamplay changing mods such as Debug Plus, System Clock and Deck Skin mods while making this mod. So don't report issues about problems related to other mods as i didn't think of the compatibility of other gameplay mods while making this one, sorry !
